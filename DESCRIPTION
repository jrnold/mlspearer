Description: Resampling and similar methods implemented include: bootstrap methods (simple bootstrap,
  weighted bootstrap, balanced bootstrap, moving-blocks bootstrap),
  test-training splits, cross-validation (leave-one-out, leave-p-out, 
  k-fold, time-series k-fold, time series rolling windows),
  jackknife (delete-one and delete-p), permutations, and rolling windows.
