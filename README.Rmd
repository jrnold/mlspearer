The **ramsleep** package provides functions that implement resampling methods including the bootstrap, jackknife, random test/train sets, k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out and leave-p-out cross-validation, time-series cross validation, time-series k-fold cross validation, permutations, rolling windows.

## Comparison to Other Packages

This is similar in approach to **modelr** functions `bootstrap` and `crossv_kfold`,
and the **rsample** package.  However, both of those packages only work with data frames.

The functions in this package are lower-level.
The functions in this package take single integer representing the number of 
items to sample from, and return lists of integers representing the indexes in each sample.
These indexes can be applied to any type of object, or used to build
higher level functions like those in **modelr** or **rsample**.

## Installation

**ramsleep** is not on CRAN. You can install the 
development version with

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrnold/ramsleep")
```
